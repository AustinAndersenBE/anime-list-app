Project Structure
- Jikan Anime API

The project is structured into two main parts: the client-side, built with React and React Hook Form, and the server-side, built with Node.js, Express, and Prisma. Passport.js and JWT are used for handling authentication.

The client-side is organized into components, each representing a part of the user interface. The server-side is organized into routes, each handling a specific type of request.
